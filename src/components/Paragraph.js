        Hello, so just a reminder the pizza night is planned for this Friday at
        20:45. I hope it suits everyone, if not let me know! Also, just let me
        know about your suggestions for the person we would like to get in. I
        would also like to mention I asm trying to think of other ways to make
        the retrospective more efficient and inclusive, the notes one that we
        did seemed to work quite well to get everyones views out so maybe we
        could do something similar again or if you prefer you can let me know
        directly and I can make sure it gets covered. But if you feel like
        everything is getting covered then no worries :slightly_smiling_face:
      </p>
    </section>
